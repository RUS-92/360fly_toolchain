Okay, so this is how I go from a bunch of 4 minute chapters in spherical to equirectangular:

ONE-TIME:
Generate map from https://github.com/prouast/equirectangular-remap/blob/master/projection.c using this command:

./project -x fly360_x.pgm -y fly360_y.pgm -h 2880 -w 2880 -r 1440 -c 2880 -m equirectangular --verbose
-> TODO: Investigate the 360Fly Director max of 3840x1920

install ffmpeg, obvs

Run ffmpeg on EACH FILE:

ffmpeg -i <INPUT_FOLDER>/FLY00101.MP4 -i fly360_x.pgm -i fly360_y.pgm -lavfi remap <OUTPUT_FOLDER>/FLY00101-equi.MP4

But then run ffmpeg on EACH FILE, AGAIN so that Davinci will import it:
ffmpeg -y -i <INPUT>.MP4 -c:v mpeg4 -force_key_frames "expr:gte(t,n_forced*1)" -r ntsc-film -b:v 250000k -c:a pcm_s16le <OUTPUT>.MOV

 -> For some reason, this step is destroying the quality.

Okay, now import them into Davinci along with something that 360Fly Director exported.
Use the transform tool to put the "blindspot" fill under the picture by overlaying the desired output over the Director video.
Looks like you need to have the fill video cropped to Top: 640

The video you want to show is transformed like so:
Position Y: 190
Zoom Y: 0.733



Do your editing and render. When you inject the metadata things will look right.
