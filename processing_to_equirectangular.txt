Okay, so this is how I go from a bunch of 4 minute chapters in spherical to equirectangular:

ONE-TIME:
Generate map from https://github.com/prouast/equirectangular-remap/blob/master/projection.c using this command:

./project -x fly360_x.pgm -y fly360_y.pgm -h 2880 -w 2880 -r 1440 -c 2880 -m equirectangular --verbose

install ffmpeg, obvs

Run ffmpeg on EACH FILE:

ffmpeg -i <INPUT_FOLDER>/FLY00101.MP4 -i fly360_x.pgm -i fly360_y.pgm -lavfi remap <OUTPUT_FOLDER>/FLY00101-equi.MP4

But then run ffmpeg on EACH FILE, AGAIN so that Davinci will import it:
ffmpeg -y -i <INPUT>.MP4 -c:v mpeg4 -force_key_frames "expr:gte(t,n_forced*1)" -r ntsc-film -b:v 250000k -c:a pcm_s16le <OUTPUT>.MOV

Okay, now import them into Davinci along with something that 360Fly Director exported.
Use the transform tool to put the "blindspot" fill under the picture by overlaying the desired output over the Director video.

Do your editing and render. When you inject the metadata things will look right.
